# Emotion-Predictor
An AI model that **tracks and predicts changes in a personâ€™s emotional state over time** based on their text inputs (social media posts, journal entries, messages, or emails). Instead of just analyzing the current sentiment, the model detects **long-term emotional patterns and predicts future emotional trends**.
